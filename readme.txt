PRINTING NOTES

Ideally this part should be printed at .1mm layer height with 100% infill for best results.

But it should also work on a well tuned printer at .2mm layer height at 100% infill.


BACKGROUND

Much of the backstory of this part is shown in this video here...

... at the 28:30 mark.  This is a tiny adapter to allow greater flexibility of use for Lishi brand 2-in-1 style decoder lockpick tools.  Lishi picks are made in different lengths for different sizes of lock.  However, due to their high cost, I thought it would be a good idea to help people adapt larger sized Lishi tools so that they work effectively in smaller locks, obviating the need to purchase additional expensive hardware.

This small collar fits over the blade of a Lishi pick to provide 0.153" of standoff distance from the front face of the plug, which makes it suitable for use on both Schlage and Kwikset style systems.


INSTALLATION

I've created a short guide video showing the best way to install this tool on a Lishi pick...
